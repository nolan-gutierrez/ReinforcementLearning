Final Reinforcement Learning project
Playing Pong with DQN and Combined Experience Replay
The agent was trained on an intel 8700k cpu with a P4000 GPU with 32 GB RAM. 
The agent took only three hours to reach its level of performance.  In order 
to use the agent, it is recommended to install Anaconda 3 on Ubuntu 16.04 although 
any Ubuntu version should work. The deep learning API used was tensorflow v2, 
and the required libraries are gym, matplotlib, pillow, opencv, ffmpeg, and 
pybullet-gym. The anaconda environment should be made as follows:

conda create -y -n gym2 pip python=3.7
conda activate gym2
conda install -y tensorflow matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
pip install pillow ffmpeg gym
pip install gym[all] 
pip install gym[atari]
To install pybulletgym: 
git clone https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym.git
cd pybullet-gym
pip install -e .

If you want to run the agent with a pretrained model, use the following:
python DQNAgent.py --visual True --testPhase True --timeToStart 0 --epsilon 0 

If you want to run the agent with the default parameters, then simply run:
python DQNAgent.py

You may examine the parameters in DQNAgent.py to adjust the model.
